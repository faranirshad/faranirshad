- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @faranirshad, a PhD student working at Center of Advanced laser applications at LMU, Munich, Germany.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using machine learning methods to optimize laser-wakefield accelerators so that they can be operated robustly for future applications.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bayesian optimization, python, data analysis of big-data coming out of modern Laser wakefield accelerators. 
- ğŸ“« I can be contacted via my personal email faranirshad@gmail.com or work email faran.irshad@lmu.de.
